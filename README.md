<h1>War Game</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
War is a simple and fast-paced card game played with a standard deck of 52 cards. Two players each receive half the deck and simultaneously reveal the top card from their stack. The player with the higher-ranked card wins both cards, placing them at the bottom of their pile. If there's a tie, a "war" ensues, where each player places three face-down cards and one face-up card, with the higher face-up card winning all the cards. The goal is to collect all the cards. War is a luck-based game with no strategy, making it a popular choice for quick, casual entertainment.
